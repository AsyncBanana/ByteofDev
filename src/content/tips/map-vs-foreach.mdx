If you are learning about iterating through arrays, you have likely come across two different methods. `Array.map()` and `Array.forEach()`. At first glance, it might seem like they are the same, as they both iterate through arrays and call a function for each item. However, they are different, and many people mix them up, which can be very bad.

### What Array.forEach() does

`Array.forEach()` is pretty simple. When you run `.forEach(function)` on an array, it calls `function` for each element with that element passed to it.

```js
const fruits = ["bananas", "pears", "oranges"];

fruits.forEach((fruit) => {
	console.log(fruit);
});
// expected output: "bananas"
// expected output: "pears"
// expected output: "oranges"
```

`Array.forEach()` does not return anything, so if you assigned a variable to it, the variable would be set to `undefined`.

### What Array.map() does differently

`Array.map()` is similar in most ways. However, it differs in one important way. Instead of not returning anything, it returns an array of new values from the result of the function callback.

```js
let fruits = ["bananas", "pears", "oranges"];

fruits = fruits.map((fruit) => {
	return `${fruit} are awesome`;
});

console.log(fruits);
// expected output: ["bananas are awesome", "pears are awesome", "oranges are awesome"]
```

This can make it easy to modify every value in an array. However, it is commonly misused to do what `Array.forEach()` is intended to do.

## Conclusion

`Array.forEach()` and `Array.map()` are related, but not the same. Use `Array.map()` when trying to modify every item in an array, and `Array.forEach()` otherwise, because you are less likely to mess up your code, and it is usually faster. Enforcing these rules also makes your code clearer and improves quality.
