ESM, also known as ES Modules (which itself is an acronym of ECMAScript Modules), is a modern module format built to replace older alternatives like CommonJS, AMD, and UMD. While its double acronym is anything but simple, ESM itself is relatively straightforward due to its JavaScript integration. However, because software like Node was built before ESM existed, we have to add some configuration to use ESM.

## What is ESM?

ES Modules is a module format created as part of the ECMAScript (read: JavaScript) standard. ES6, which you might know for adding features like Promises and arrow functions, was the first version to include it. ES Modules aims to solve a significant problem in JavaScript: There is no built-in way to share code between scripts. Bundlers like Webpack and runtimes like Node include CommonJS (you probably have seen its `require()`s), but these tools have to implement CommonJS in a layer on top of vanilla JavaScript, and you can't use CommonJS without that layer. Older module formats also suffer from outdated design decisions—many were designed >15 years ago when the web was a very different place.

ESM aims to solve all of these issues while making one module format universal. Today, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox fully support ESM, so you should not have any problem running it in modern browsers. Additionally, Node v12+ supports ESM, although you have to tell it you are using ESM rather than CommonJS. We will talk more about how to do this later on.

## ESM Syntax

The syntax used to import and export modules is slightly more complicated than in other module systems like CommonJS, but it is still fairly easy to pick up. The most basic example is this:

```js
// library.js
export const example = function () {
	console.log("hello world");
};

// script.js
import { example } from "./library.js";
example();
```

Here we import a function called `example` from `library.js`. Pretty simple. Of course, we only import one function there. If we want to import multiple things from the same file, we would do this:

```js
// library.js
export const example = function () {
	console.log("hello world");
};
export const example2 = function () {
	console.log("Hello world 2");
};

// script.js
import { example, example2 } from "./library.js";
```

As you can see, we put both `example` and `example2` between the brackets to import both exported variables. Now, what if a file only had one thing to export? We simplify imports by removing brackets if we use `export default` instead of `export`.

```js
// library.js
export default function () {
	console.log("hello world");
}

// script.js
import defaultExample from "./library.js";
defaultExample();
```

Default exports also allow us to name the imported value whatever we want. We can do this with named exports, but it is a little more complicated:

```js
import { example as newExampleName } from "./library.js";
newExampleName();
```

Unfortunately, all of these examples require imports to be at the top of the file. If you only want to import something when a particular condition is true, or even import with a dynamic URL, you can use dynamic imports. Dynamic imports allow you to import with a function, similar to `require()` in CommonJS, except asynchronous.

```js
if (window.localStorage.get("loadModule") == "1") {
	// ./library.js will only load if `loadModule`==`1`
	import("./library.js").then((library) => {
		// handle the promise here
		library.default();
	});
}
```

Finally, you might want to import all exports in a module, which you can do using `import * as`:

```js
// library.js
export const example = function () {
	console.log("hello world");
};
export const example2 = function () {
	console.log("hello world 2");
};

// script.js
import * as library from "./library.js";
library.example();
library.example2();
```

## Using ESM with Node

<Callout type="warning">Make sure you are using Node v12 or higher</Callout>

### Per-file

The simplest way to use ESM in Node.js is to use `.mjs` instead of `.js` as the file extension of your script. The new file extension tells Node to treat the file as ESM rather than CJS. This naming scheme also works the other way. You can use `.cjs` to designate a file as CommonJS if the default is ESM (more on that in the next section).

### Package-wide

Often, you want a whole package to be ESM by default. To do this, you must add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json`. Adding `"type": "module"` means files will be treated as ESM files unless they have a `.cjs` extension. However, dependencies can still use CommonJS.

### Importing CJS Modules From ESM

To ease the transition to ESM, Node can load CommonJS modules from ESM. You can retrieve the `module.exports` object by importing it as a default export. For example:

```js
// example-package index.cjs
module.exports = {
	helloworld: function () {
		console.log("hello world");
	},
};

// script.mjs
import example from "example-package";
example.helloworld();
```

This feature is very helpful as it allows you to use NPM packages built with CommonJS.

### Importing ES Modules from CJS

Unfortunately, Node does not support importing ES Modules from CommonJS modules. Luckily, many compilers allow you to convert ESM to CommonJS, allowing you to write a library that offers a great experience for both groups. TypeScript is the most notable in this category. You can write code using ES Modules and target both ESM and CJS.

### Migrating from CJS To ESM

There are tools to help make migrating code from CommonJS to ES Modules easy. One of the most popular tools is [cjstoesm](https://github.com/wessberg/cjstoesm), a command line tool that automatically transforms almost all CommonJS code in Node to its ESM equivalent. However, cjstoesm can't convert all CJS features. The most notable feature missing is `__dirname`. `__dirname` is part of Node.js' CommonJS environment but is excluded in "ESM mode." Luckily, there are replacements. A simple way to polyfill `__dirname` is to do this:

```js
const __dirname = new URL(".", import.meta.url).pathname;
```

This snippet uses `import.meta.url`, which is available in all ESM contexts.

You will also have to manually migrate conditional imports. You can use dynamic imports to replace running `require()` dynamically, but problems arise due to how `import()` is asynchronous and `require()` is not. Luckily, there is a simple solution to this. If you are on Node.js v14.8 or later, you can use [top-level await](https://v8.dev/features/top-level-await) to make `import()` synchronous. For example,

```js
// CommonJS
const module = boolean ? require("module1") : require("module2");

// ES Modules
const module = await (boolean ? import("module1") : import("module2"));
```

With these tips, you should not have much trouble converting CommonJS code to ES Modules.

### Avoiding Node Entirely

In the past few years, developers sick of Node's legacy design decisions like defaulting to CommonJS have created new runtimes, like [Deno](https://byteofdev.com/posts/deno/) and [Bun](https://byteofdev.com/posts/what-is-bun/). Not only do these runtimes include ESM support, but they use ESM by default. Of course, you can still use Node-style CommonJS modules if necessary—in fact, unlike Node, Bun supports importing ES Module code from CommonJS code.

These runtimes include a variety of other unique features, but [Node is catching up](https://byteofdev.com/posts/what-javascript-needs-2025/), so don't jump to them too quickly. Either way, they are good choices to consider.

## Using ESM on the Web

### Native ESM

The simplest way to use ESM on the web is by utilizing native support. For about over 95% of users ([Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/es6-module)), ESM is supported without polyfills. To load a script with ESM, add `type="module"` in the script tag.

```html
<script src="./esmscript.js" type="module">
```

Then, all modules you import from that script will also load as ES modules.

To create a backup script for browsers that do not support ES Modules, you can use the `nomodule` attribute. `nomodule` tells any browser that supports ES Modules not to load the script, so only browsers without ESM support will load it.

```html
<script src="./fallback.js" nomodule>
```

### Bundlers

While using the browser's native ESM support is simple, you will be missing out on many features and [optimizations to speed up your JavaScript loading](https://byteofdev.com/posts/speed-up-javascript-loading/), like tree shaking, support for CommonJS dependencies, and automatic fallback generation. Luckily, many [bundlers](https://byteofdev.com/posts/bundlers/) support ESM by default. The web's most notable modern ESM bundler is [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Vite is a bundler created by the Vue team that is extremely fast and feature-rich. By default, Vite minifies and optimizes your code while allowing you to do more with plugins. Vite also supports including CommonJS code is necessary. Of course, including CommonJS still has the disadvantages already mentioned.

To create a Vite project, run `npm create vite@latest`, which will help you set up a project with Vite using ES Modules. If you want legacy browser support using `nomodule`, you can use the plugin [@vitejs/plugin-legacy](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-legacy).

### Import Maps

While bundlers are great, you may want to avoid using them due to the increased complexity of the build process. However, you might still want to import things using Node-style short package specifiers (e.g. "react" rather than "https://esm.run/react"). Or perhaps you want to use a library that imports via specifiers like these, but you don't want to modify its code. Luckily, modern browsers have a solution to this problem: import maps.

\Import maps are scripts with `type="importmap"` that contain JSON objects routing certain specifiers to URLs. For example, let's say you wanted to be able to import things from `"react"`. You would create the following import map:

```html
<script type="importmap">
	{
		"imports": {
			"react": "https://esm.run/react@18.2.0"
		}
	}
</script>
```

The above import map essentially turns this import:

```js
import { useEffect } from "react";
```

Into this:

```js
import { useEffect } from "https://esm.run/react@18.2.0";
```

This will affect all modules on that webpage. You can also map by a prefix:

```html
<script type="importmap">
	{
		"imports": {
			"scripts/": "https://example.com/scripts/"
		}
	}
</script>
```

This will reroute all `scripts/...` imports to `https://example.com/scripts/...`. For example, `scripts/test` would reroute to `https://example.com/scripts/test`.

Imports maps are currently [all modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/import-maps), but some older versions

## Conclusion

ES Modules is the future of JavaScript and should continue to see adoption rise as more tools support it. Unfortunately, despite having existed for almost ten years, it still isn't the standard in many areas due to the difficulty of migrating legacy software. Hopefully, this guide helped you integrate ESM into your software.
